My name is Yan Huang. I received the BSc degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2012, 
and the PhD degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017. 
Since July 2017, I has joined the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), 
Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) as an assistant professor. 
My research interests include computer vision and multimodal learning, especially cross-modal retrieval and video person analysis. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie in financial economics. I've researched how banks cause credit frictions to the real economy, how they interact with regulators and how their CEOs/CFOs words can be used to proxy the uncertainty banks face. Helping me along the way, I've been learning how to apply recent techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to these economic problems. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://yanrockhuang.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> and my <a href="https://yanrockhuang.github.io/tutorials" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!
